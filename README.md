## 👋 Hi there, I'm Lahari Bade

I'm a curious and driven developer on a mission to build thoughtful, scalable software that makes a real-world impact. Currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University (GPA 3.9), I bring a blend of **industry-grade development** and **research-backed innovation** to everything I build.

Previously, I worked as a Software Developer at Infosys, where I helped **build and maintain web platforms for Lexus and Toyota Europe**. My work included optimizing .NET and JavaScript modules, integrating SSO for a smoother login experience, and managing large-scale customer-facing pages that improved engagement and reliability. I also handled **incident and service request tickets** using **ServiceNow and Jira**, resolving critical issues for users and supporting teams with timely, well-documented solutions.

At KSU, I’ve transitioned into research and simulation. I developed an **AI-enhanced Unity simulation** for medical triage training, boosting scenario accuracy and user engagement by over 30%. I’m also co-authoring a paper focused on AI in virtual healthcare training, currently under peer review.
